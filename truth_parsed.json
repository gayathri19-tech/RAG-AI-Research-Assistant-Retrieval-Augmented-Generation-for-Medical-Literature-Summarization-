      "a": "The researchers initially coded data within LTC case groups (e.g., metabolic, respiratory) but found that the lived experience described by service users did not differ in ways related to their specific LTC diagnosis. Because the core challenges were consistent across conditions, they proceeded with a single thematic analysis of all service user data.",
