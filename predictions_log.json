  {
    "question": "What is the core outcome set?",
    "answer": "**Core Outcome Set (COS)**  \nA core outcome set is a *standardised, agreed‑upon list of outcomes* that should be measured and reported in every clinical trial (or other research study) that addresses a particular condition or intervention. The idea is to bring consistency across studies so that results can be compared, combined, and interpreted more reliably.\n\n### Why a COS matters\n1. **Reduces outcome‑reporting bias** – Researchers are less likely to cherry‑pick outcomes that look favourable if they know a fixed set must be reported.\n2. **Improves comparability** – When every study measures the same key outcomes, systematic reviews and meta‑analyses can pool data more easily.\n3. **Ensures relevance** – The outcomes selected are usually those that matter most to patients, clinicians, policymakers, and other stakeholders.\n4. **Facilitates synthesis** – A common language for outcomes makes it easier to aggregate evidence across trials, especially when interventions differ.\n\n### How a COS is developed\n1. **Systematic review of existing trials** – Identify what outcomes have already been measured and how they were defined.\n2. **Stakeholder engagement** – Patients, clinicians, researchers, regulators, and sometimes payers discuss which outcomes are most important.\n3. **Consensus methods** – Techniques such as Delphi surveys, nominal group techniques, or consensus workshops are used to rank and agree on a final list.\n4. **Documentation** – The agreed set is published (often with a protocol, a list of outcome definitions, and measurement instruments) so that future trials can adopt it.\n\n### Example from the context you provided\n- In the field of **type 2 diabetes care for people with severe mental illness (SMI)**, researchers have identified that while many outcomes (e.g., glucose control, blood pressure, self‑management behaviours) are routinely measured, there is **no existing COS** that specifically addresses the needs of this dual‑diagnosis population.  \n- The absence of a COS makes it hard to combine evidence from different studies because each study might report different outcomes or use different definitions.  \n- The work you cited describes a process where a group of experts and stakeholders (including patients) went through several rounds of rating and discussion to reach consensus on the most important outcomes for this group. The resulting COS would then guide future trials to include those core outcomes (e.g., self‑management of diabetes, glycaemic control, blood pressure, quality of life, etc.) so that results are comparable and truly relevant to those affected.\n\n### Bottom line\nA core outcome set is a **consensus‑derived, mandatory list of outcomes** that researchers agree to measure and report in all studies of a particular condition or intervention. It promotes consistency, transparency, and relevance across the research landscape."

    "question": "So what were the outcomes from the COS?",
    "answer": "Based on the information provided, the core outcome set (COS) that was agreed upon for diabetes self‑management in people with type 2 diabetes and serious mental illness (SMI) included:\n\n1. **Self‑management of diabetes** – the extent to which participants engage in the behaviours and practices that keep their diabetes under control.  \n2. **Glucose control** – typically measured by HbA1c or other glycaemic indices.  \n3. **Blood pressure** – systolic and/or diastolic blood‑pressure readings.\n\nThese three outcomes were the ones that reached consensus for inclusion in the final workshop. The text does not list any additional outcomes that were formally added to the COS."

    "question": " What are the categories of participant withdrawal in the DIAMONDS trial?",
    "answer": "In the DIAMONDS trial the investigators defined **three distinct withdrawal categories** for participants:\n\n| Category | What it means | What data continue to be collected |\n|----------|---------------|------------------------------------|\n| **1. Withdrawal from the intervention only** | The participant stops engaging with the intervention (e.g., stops using the coach‑led workbook or other intervention components) but remains in the study. | Follow‑up data (outcome measures, questionnaires, etc.) are still collected. |\n| **2. Withdrawal from follow‑up only** | The participant continues to receive the intervention but elects not to provide further follow‑up data. | Intervention‑related data (e.g., usage logs, adherence) are still captured. |\n| **3. Full withdrawal** | The participant disengages from both the intervention and the follow‑up; no further data are collected. | No additional data are gathered after this point. |\n\nThese categories were used to manage participant data appropriately and to ensure that any data retained were used only up to the point of withdrawal."

  {
    "question": "What was the main aim of the DIAMONDS trial?",
    "answer": "The DIAMONDS trial was designed to determine whether a tailored, coach‑led self‑management program could improve health outcomes for people who have both type 2 diabetes and a serious mental illness. In other words, its main aim was to evaluate the clinical effectiveness and cost‑effectiveness of the DIAMONDS intervention (the “Change One Thing” app, workbook and coaching sessions) for this dual‑diagnosis population."

    "question": "Explain the theme of 'the constellation of support' as it relates to self-management for people with SMI",
    "answer": "**The “constellation of support”** is a theme that emerged from the research to describe the *wide, interrelated web of help* that people with serious mental illness (SMI) need in order to manage both their mental and physical health conditions. It highlights that self‑management is not a solitary task but one that relies on many different kinds of resources, each playing a distinct role.\n\n---\n\n### 1.  What the constellation includes\n\n| Type of support | Typical source | What it offers for self‑management |\n|-----------------|----------------|------------------------------------|\n| **Formal professional care** | Psychiatrists, primary‑care doctors, nurses, allied health professionals | Structured treatment plans, medication monitoring, health education |\n| **Informal or peer support** | Family, friends, peer‑support groups, volunteers | Emotional encouragement, shared experience, practical tips |\n| **Instrumental support** | Transportation services, mobile health apps, reminder systems | Practical help with appointments, medication adherence, daily routines |\n| **Structural or systemic support** | Integrated care pathways, case‑management services, policy initiatives | Coordination across services, reduced fragmentation |\n| **Technological support** | Smartphones, tele‑health platforms, online resources | Remote monitoring, access to information, self‑tracking tools |\n\nThe theme stresses that these supports are *not isolated.* They overlap, reinforce one another, and sometimes compete for the individual’s time and attention. For example, a patient might rely on a mobile app to remember medication but still need a trusted friend to help them attend a clinic appointment.\n\n---\n\n### 2.  Why the constellation matters for people with SMI\n\n1. **Complex, intertwined needs** – SMI and long‑term conditions (LTCs) are “enmeshed”; physical health problems can worsen mental symptoms and vice versa. A single source of help rarely addresses both dimensions simultaneously.\n2. **Unpredictable course** – SMI is described as a “roller‑coaster” that can change abruptly. Having multiple supports in place allows for rapid response when a crisis or a sudden health issue arises.\n3. **Prioritisation of short‑term over long‑term** – Individuals often focus on immediate mental‑health needs, which can sideline chronic physical‑health management. A constellation of supports can help keep long‑term self‑management on the agenda.\n4. **Barriers to engagement** – The research found that people with SMI may not use certain supports (e.g., technology) if they are not interested, lack access, or feel the service is not relevant. A diverse array of options increases the likelihood that at least one will fit the person’s preferences and circumstances.\n\n---\n\n### 3.  Challenges highlighted by the theme\n\n- **Unmet support needs** – Even when services exist, people with SMI often report that they still lack the help they need. This can be due to fragmented care, limited resources, or insufficient tailoring to individual circumstances.\n- **Inconsistent use of technology** – While digital tools can aid self‑management, the research notes that many users sign up and then never use the app, indicating a mismatch between design and lived experience.\n- **Carer fatigue and lack of support for carers** – Carers themselves face health challenges and may need support, but the research shows uncertainty about how best to provide it.\n- **Need for holistic, joined‑up care** – The theme underlines that formal services must be integrated with informal and structural supports to truly support whole‑person health.\n\n---\n\n### 4.  Practical implications\n\n1. **Design services that are multi‑modal** – Offer a mix of face‑to‑face, digital, and peer‑support options.\n2. **Ensure coordination** – Use case managers or integrated care pathways to align mental‑health and physical‑health plans.\n3. **Tailor to individual preferences** – Assess each person’s willingness and ability to engage with different support types.\n4. **Address carers’ needs** – Provide resources and respite for carers to maintain their own health and capacity to support the person with SMI.\n5. **Monitor and adapt** – Regularly review whether the constellation of supports remains effective as the person’s condition evolves.\n\n---\n\nIn sum, **the constellation of support** is a conceptual framework that captures the multiplicity of help‑sources required for people with SMI to manage both mental and physical health. It underscores that self‑management is most successful when supported by a coordinated, flexible, and person‑centered network of formal, informal, instrumental, and structural resources."

    "question": " what specific barriers were identified for using digital applications like the 'My COPD app' to support patients with SMI?",
    "answer": "The study highlighted a number of concrete, user‑level obstacles that made it difficult for people with serious mental illness (SMI) to adopt a digital self‑management tool such as the “My COPD” app:\n\n| Barrier | What it means in practice |\n|---------|---------------------------|\n| **Digital exclusion** | Many SMI patients simply do not have access to a smartphone, tablet or reliable internet connection. |\n| **Lack of digital literacy** | Users often do not have an email address, cannot navigate a web browser, or are unfamiliar with basic app‑use skills (e.g., logging in, updating information). |\n| **Competing mental‑health demands** | Symptoms such as paranoia, anxiety, or cognitive impairment can make it hard to focus on a new technology or remember to use it consistently. |\n| **Short‑term crisis focus** | In acute episodes, both patients and clinicians tend to prioritise immediate symptom relief rather than long‑term chronic‑condition self‑management, so the app is seen as a lower priority. |\n| **Insufficient carer support** | Carers themselves often lack digital skills or time to help patients set up and troubleshoot the app, limiting the patient’s ability to use it. |\n| **Design mismatch** | The app’s interface and workflow were not fully adapted to the cognitive and motivational profiles of people with SMI, making it feel overwhelming or irrelevant. |\n| **Perceived burden** | Adding a new digital tool was viewed as an extra task that could increase the overall burden of managing multiple long‑term conditions. |\n\nThese barriers were identified through interviews and usability testing with both patients and their carers, and they collectively explain why the “My COPD” app struggled to gain traction in this population."

    "question": "Explain the theme of 'sacrificing physical health to manage mental health'. Please include a direct quote from a service user or carer to illustrate this point.",
    "answer": "**Theme: “Sacrificing physical health to manage mental health”**\n\nThis theme captures a pervasive pattern among people living with serious mental illness (SMI) in which the day‑to‑day demands of mental health take priority over, and often come at the expense of, physical health. Service users and carers describe a cycle in which the urgency of managing psychiatric symptoms—whether it’s anxiety, paranoia, or mood instability—leads to neglect of routine physical care (e.g., medication adherence, exercise, nutrition, or attending medical appointments). Because physical health problems can exacerbate mental distress, the neglect of the body can actually reinforce the mental illness, creating a self‑reinforcing loop that is difficult to break.\n\nKey points illustrated by the data:\n\n| What happens | Why it matters |\n|--------------|----------------|\n| **Mental health takes precedence** – people focus on stabilising mood or managing psychotic symptoms. | This focus leaves little time, energy, or motivation for physical self‑care. |\n| **Physical needs are deprioritised** – missed appointments, poor diet, lack of exercise. | Unmanaged physical conditions (e.g., hypertension, diabetes) worsen, adding to the overall burden of illness. |\n| **The cycle is self‑reinforcing** – untreated physical illness can worsen psychiatric symptoms, which in turn further reduces motivation to care for the body. | This leads to a spiral of deteriorating health on both fronts. |\n| **Support structures often fail to address this interplay** – services tend to treat mental and physical health separately, missing the opportunity to integrate care. | Integrated, holistic models are needed to break the cycle. |\n\n**Illustrative quote**\n\n> “… a lot of people I see don’t think their physical health’s really important, they’re more concerned about mental health, so when I ring them and say, …” – *Carer, CKMPT002*\n\nThis statement directly shows how the priority given to mental health can eclipse the importance of physical health, reinforcing the theme that individuals with SMI often sacrifice bodily well‑being in order to manage their psychiatric symptoms."

    "question": "What reasons did healthcare professionals give for the difficulty in rolling out the \"My COPD app\"?",
    "answer": "Healthcare professionals cited several practical and contextual barriers that made it hard to roll out the “My COPD” app:\n\n| Reason | What it meant in practice |\n|--------|---------------------------|\n| **Digital exclusion** | Many people with severe mental illness (SMI) did not have reliable internet access or the devices needed to use an app. |\n| **Limited digital literacy** | Even when devices were available, patients often did not know how to operate a smartphone or navigate an app. |\n| **Missing digital credentials** | A key requirement for the app was an email address – a number of patients simply did not have one, which prevented them from signing up. |\n| **Competing priorities and episodic engagement** | The episodic, sometimes traumatic nature of SMI meant that patients’ attention and motivation to use a new digital tool were inconsistent. |\n| **Short‑term focus of the app** | The app was designed to support short‑term, goal‑oriented self‑management, which did not align with the longer‑term, chronic‑condition needs that many users had. |\n| **Integration with existing care pathways** | Staff noted that the app did not fit neatly into the routine workflows of primary‑care teams, making it harder to embed into routine practice. |\n\nIn short, the main obstacles were the digital divide (lack of devices, internet, email, and skills) and the mismatch between the app’s design and the realities of caring for people with SMI and multiple long‑term conditions."

    "question": "How were the interview transcripts analysed, and what was the name of the software used for data management?",
    "answer": "**Method of analysis**\n\nThe interview and focus‑group transcripts were examined using **thematic analysis**.  \n* The transcripts were first *initially coded* by two of the three researchers who had experience in the field.  \n* Coding was carried out within an existing coding framework that was developed from the interview guide and the semi‑structured observation field notes.  \n* After the initial pass, the researchers reviewed the codes across all cases, looking for patterns and relationships.  \n* Themes and sub‑themes were then *inductively generated* from the list of codes, and the proposed themes were refined in iterative discussions with the rest of the research team.  \n* The analysis was carried out as a single, integrated thematic analysis of all service‑user data (rather than separate analyses for each diagnosis group), while the healthcare‑professional transcripts were treated as a distinct group and analysed separately.\n\n**Software used for data management**\n\nAll audio recordings were transcribed verbatim and then **imported into NVivo 12** (the qualitative data analysis software). NVivo was used to store the transcripts, manage the coding process, and facilitate the generation and review of themes."

    "question": "How do past negative experiences with mental health services affect a service user's willingness to seek help for their physical health conditions?",
    "answer": "Prior negative experiences with mental‑health services can strongly discourage a person from seeking help for their physical health problems. The accounts in the excerpts show that:\n\n| How negative mental‑health experiences shape attitudes toward physical‑health care |\n|---|\n| **Mistrust and fear of being mistreated** – Users describe being treated “badly in hospital,” “like a criminal,” or “traumatising” by mental‑health staff.  That fear spills over into all health settings, making them reluctant to approach any clinician, even for physical complaints. |\n| **Stigma and labeling** – The sense that they are “criminalised” or that their mental illness is a “label” that will color every interaction leads to a belief that any health‑care visit will be judged or misunderstood. |\n| **Avoidance of appointments** – Because of the chaotic lifestyle that often accompanies serious mental illness, users worry that missing a mental‑health appointment will result in punitive or dismissive treatment. This anxiety extends to physical‑health appointments, so they skip or cancel them. |\n| **Reduced willingness to seek help** – The overarching narrative is that negative experiences “put me off seeking help” and “reduce willingness to engage in any form of help.”  This includes primary‑care visits, specialist appointments, or routine screening for chronic conditions. |\n| **Compounded self‑management burden** – When mental‑health care is perceived as hostile, users feel they cannot rely on professionals to support the self‑management of long‑term physical conditions.  They may try to manage alone, but the lack of professional guidance can worsen both mental and physical health. |\n\nIn short, a history of being treated poorly, judged, or stigmatized in mental‑health settings erodes trust in the health‑care system as a whole. That erosion makes service users less likely to seek or continue care for their physical health, which can lead to untreated chronic conditions and a downward spiral in overall well‑being."

    "question": "What is \"trauma-informed care,\" and why do the authors suggest it may help improve engagement with health services for people with SMI?",
    "answer": "**Trauma‑informed care (TIC)** is an approach to health‑service delivery that recognises the widespread impact of trauma and seeks to create an environment that is safe, trustworthy, collaborative, and empowering for all patients—especially those who have experienced past or ongoing trauma.  \n\n| Core principle | What it means in practice | Why it matters for people with SMI |\n|----------------|--------------------------|-----------------------------------|\n| **Safety** | Physical and psychological safety is prioritized (e.g., predictable routines, clear boundaries, respectful communication). | Many people with SMI have histories of abuse, neglect, or coercive treatment; feeling unsafe can trigger anxiety or relapse. |\n| **Trustworthiness & Transparency** | Staff communicate openly about procedures, limits, and decision‑making; they avoid hidden agendas. | Trust deficits are common in SMI populations, often stemming from previous negative encounters with health or social services. |\n| **Peer Support & Collaboration** | Patients are partners in care planning; their lived experience is valued. | Peer‑led support can reduce isolation and empower patients to advocate for themselves. |\n| **Choice & Empowerment** | Patients are offered options and are involved in setting goals. | Autonomy is often eroded in SMI care; reclaiming control can improve motivation and adherence. |\n| **Cultural, Historical, and Gender Issues** | Services adapt to diverse cultural backgrounds and recognise systemic inequities. | SMI patients from marginalized groups may face compounded stigma; culturally sensitive care can mitigate this. |\n| **Resilience & Strength‑Based Focus** | Emphasis is placed on patients’ strengths and coping skills, not just deficits. | Focusing on resilience can counteract the negative self‑conceptions that often accompany SMI. |\n\n---\n\n### Why trauma‑informed care can improve engagement for people with serious mental illness\n\n1. **Reduces re‑traumatization**  \n   - Traditional mental‑health settings sometimes involve coercive practices (e.g., restraints, involuntary admission).  \n   - TIC explicitly avoids or minimises these tactics, lowering the risk that patients feel “treated like a patient” rather than a person.  \n   - As Carswell et al. (2022) note, reducing iatrogenic harm in health‑care settings can improve willingness to attend appointments.\n\n2. **Builds trust and reduces stigma**  \n   - Stigma and discrimination are major barriers to care (Thornicroft, 2008).  \n   - By fostering a non‑judgmental, respectful atmosphere, TIC counters internalised stigma and encourages patients to seek help.\n\n3. **Supports self‑management of comorbid physical conditions**  \n   - People with SMI often have co‑existing long‑term conditions (LTCs) that require routine monitoring.  \n   - A trauma‑informed approach that emphasises empowerment and collaborative goal‑setting can help patients feel capable of managing both mental and physical health (Gately et al., 2007).\n\n4. **Encourages patient agency and decision‑making**  \n   - Choice and empowerment are central to TIC.  \n   - When patients feel they have a say in their care, they are more likely to attend appointments, adhere to medication, and engage in lifestyle changes.\n\n5. **Addresses systemic barriers**  \n   - TIC acknowledges that trauma often intersects with social determinants of health (poverty, housing instability, discrimination).  \n   - By integrating social support and linking patients to community resources, services become more holistic and accessible.\n\n6. **Improves staff–patient relationships**  \n   - Training in TIC equips clinicians with skills to recognise trauma‑related cues and respond sensitively.  \n   - Positive therapeutic alliances are a key predictor of treatment adherence (Carswell et al., 2022).\n\n---\n\n### Bottom line\n\nTrauma‑informed care is not a single intervention but a framework that reshapes how health services are delivered. By prioritising safety, trust, choice, and empowerment—and by actively recognising and responding to the trauma histories that many people with serious mental illness carry—TIC reduces barriers to care, mitigates re‑traumatization, and supports sustained engagement with both mental‑health and physical‑health services."

    "question": "What did service users mean when they described SMI as a 'rollercoaster disease' in the qualitative study on co-existing mental and physical conditions?",
    "answer": "In the Carswell et al. (2022) study, service users used the phrase **“rollercoaster disease”** to describe the way that severe mental illness (SMI) feels in everyday life.  They were not talking about a literal amusement‑park ride, but about the **fluctuating and unpredictable pattern of symptoms** that characterises many people’s experience of SMI.  \n\nKey points that the service users highlighted when they used this metaphor were:\n\n| What the metaphor captured | Why it mattered for the participants |\n|---------------------------|---------------------------------------|\n| **Cycles of highs and lows** – periods of relative stability or “good days” followed by sudden “bad days” of intensified psychotic or mood symptoms. | These swings made it hard to plan or maintain consistent routines, including those needed for physical‑health self‑management. |\n| **Unpredictability** – the timing and severity of episodes were hard to anticipate. | The uncertainty meant that people could not reliably schedule medical appointments, take medication on time, or keep up with healthy habits. |\n| **Emotional turbulence** – the experience of intense distress, anxiety, or mania that feels like a rapid ascent, followed by a steep drop. | The emotional peaks and troughs were often described as the “most difficult” part of living with SMI, and they dominated the participants’ day‑to‑day focus. |\n| **Impact on physical health** – because the mind is “on the ride,” basic self‑care (eating, washing, exercising) often takes a back seat. | Service users reported that their physical health was frequently neglected or worsened during mental‑health crises, reinforcing the sense that the rollercoaster was “just a ride” that left them behind. |\n\nIn short, the “rollercoaster disease” metaphor was a way for service users to convey that SMI is a **continuous, uneven, and emotionally charged experience** that alternates between relative calm and acute distress.  This pattern makes it difficult to keep a steady course in managing both mental and physical health, and it underscores why many people with SMI find their physical health needs are often sidelined."

    "question": "According to the paper by Coxon et al., what specific action did the researchers take when an article did not report information on the inclusion of people with SMI?",
    "answer": "In the Coxon et al. review, the presence of people with serious mental illness (SMI) was a **mandatory** eligibility criterion.  \nWhen an article failed to state whether its participants included individuals with SMI, the authors treated it as a **non‑eligible study** and **excluded it from the pooled analysis**. They did not attempt to contact authors for clarification; instead, the lack of reporting was taken as evidence that the study did not meet the SMI inclusion requirement. This approach ensured that only studies with a clear SMI component contributed to the review’s findings."

    "question": "How does the finding that 42% of DSME trials excluded people with SMI support the authors' claim of \"health inequity\"?",
    "answer": "The authors point out that diabetes self‑management education (DSME) is a proven way to improve glycaemic control and other health outcomes in the general diabetic population.  However, when they looked at the evidence base for people who also have a severe mental illness (SMI), they found that **42 % of the DSME trials explicitly excluded participants with SMI**.\n\n### Why this figure illustrates health inequity\n\n| What the 42 % exclusion means | How it creates inequity |\n|-------------------------------|--------------------------|\n| **Systematic non‑representation** – Almost half of the trials did not allow people with SMI to participate. | **Evidence gap** – The interventions that are shown to work in the general population are not tested, and therefore not proven, for a group that actually has a higher prevalence of diabetes and worse outcomes. |\n| **Reduced access to proven care** – DSME programmes are often delivered in research settings or funded through evidence‑based guidelines. | **Limited service availability** – If a programme is not supported by evidence for SMI patients, clinicians and payers are less likely to offer it to them, effectively denying them a standard of care. |\n| **Perpetuation of stigma** – Exclusion signals that people with SMI are considered “unfit” or “too difficult” for standard interventions. | **Social determinants of health** – Stigma, lack of tailored resources, and institutional barriers are key drivers of health inequity; the exclusion reinforces these barriers. |\n| **Generalizability of findings** – The results of the 58 % of trials that did include SMI participants are not automatically applicable to the whole SMI population. | **Unequal benefits** – Even when DSME is offered, it may not be equally effective for SMI patients, leading to persistent disparities in health outcomes. |\n\nIn short, the fact that a substantial proportion of DSME trials deliberately left out people with serious mental illness demonstrates that this vulnerable group is **systematically excluded from the research that informs standard care**.  This exclusion creates a cycle in which:\n\n1. **Evidence is missing** for SMI patients →  \n2. **Guidelines and funding decisions** are based on incomplete data →  \n3. **Access to effective self‑management education** is limited for SMI patients →  \n4. **Health outcomes remain poorer** for this group.\n\nThus, the 42 % exclusion rate is a concrete illustration of the authors’ claim that people with SMI experience health inequity in diabetes care."

    "answer": "**Qualitative data analysis plan (acceptability of the intervention & CGM)**  \n\n1. **Transcription & data preparation**  \n   * All audio‑recorded interviews and focus‑groups will be transcribed verbatim.  \n   * Transcripts will be checked for accuracy and anonymised prior to coding.\n\n2. **Thematic / framework analysis**  \n   * The research team will use a **thematic analysis** approach, guided by the **Theoretical Domains Framework (TDF)**.  \n   * A coding framework will be developed that maps key acceptability constructs (e.g., affective attitude, perceived effectiveness, self‑efficacy, social influence, environmental context, etc.) onto the TDF domains.  \n   * Two independent coders will apply the framework to the transcripts, discuss discrepancies, and refine the codebook through an iterative process.\n\n3. **Triangulation with quantitative data**  \n   * For each qualitative theme that emerges, the team will systematically search the quantitative dataset for corresponding indicators (e.g., adherence rates, CGM usage metrics, clinical outcomes).  \n   * The relationship between qualitative and quantitative findings will be classified into one of four categories:  \n     1. **Agreement** – qualitative and quantitative data converge.  \n     2. **Partial agreement** – complementary but not overlapping evidence.  \n     3. **Silence** – no corresponding quantitative data.  \n     4. **Dissonance** – conflicting evidence.  \n   * This cross‑check will help confirm, extend, or challenge the acceptability findings.\n\n4. **Member checking & stakeholder involvement**  \n   * Preliminary themes and interpretations will be presented to a small group of service users (participants and carers) for validation and feedback.  \n   * Feedback will be incorporated to refine the analysis and ensure that the findings resonate with lived experience.\n\n5. **Audit trail & reflexivity**  \n   * The coding process, decisions on theme inclusion, and the triangulation matrix will be documented in an audit trail.  \n   * Reflexive notes will be kept by the analysts to capture potential biases and how they were addressed.\n\n6. **Reporting**  \n   * Findings will be presented in a narrative format, supplemented with illustrative quotes, and linked explicitly to the TDF domains and the four triangulation categories.  \n   * The final report will discuss how the qualitative evidence informs the acceptability of the intervention and CGM, and how it aligns (or not) with the quantitative outcomes.\n\nIn short, the team will conduct a systematic, framework‑guided thematic analysis of interview data, triangulate these themes with quantitative measures, and use a structured categorisation (agreement, partial agreement, silence, dissonance) to evaluate the acceptability of both the intervention and continuous glucose monitoring."

    "question": "How did the COVID-19 pandemic influence the choice of a single-group study design for this feasibility work?",
    "answer": "The pandemic made it difficult to run a full randomized controlled trial in the NHS setting.  Because the COVID‑19 surge had already stretched staff, resources and clinic capacity, the research team judged that they could not feasibly recruit, randomise and follow two groups while still delivering the intervention.  In practice this meant that the feasibility study was scaled back to a single‑group design – a one‑arm pilot that could still test the intervention’s delivery, acceptability and the study procedures, but without the additional logistical and ethical demands of a control arm.  Thus, the reduced NHS capacity during the pandemic directly influenced the decision to use a single‑group design for the feasibility study."

    "question": "How does this study build upon previous research trials like SCIMITAR+, STEPWISE, and PRIMROSE?",
    "answer": "**How the current DIAMONDS study builds on SCIMITAR+, STEPWISE and PRIMROSE**\n\n| Earlier trial | Key focus / findings | Main limitations | How DIAMONDS extends it |\n|---------------|----------------------|------------------|------------------------|\n| **SCIMITAR+** (Gil‑Brown et al., 2010) | A 25‑year cohort study of people with schizophrenia, highlighting the high mortality and the need for integrated physical‑health care. | • Limited to a single diagnostic group (schizophrenia). <br>• No experimental intervention; purely observational. | • DIAMONDS recruits a broader “serious mental illness” (SMI) population (including schizophrenia, bipolar, etc.). <br>• Uses a randomized controlled design to test a structured intervention. |\n| **STEPWISE** (Holt et al., 2019) | Complex‑intervention trial testing stepped‑up care for people with SMI. | • Small sample size and short follow‑up. <br>• Limited data on implementation processes and cost‑effectiveness. | • DIAMONDS incorporates an internal pilot to refine recruitment and retention, then scales up to a definitive trial. <br>• Adds a full economic evaluation and a detailed process evaluation to capture implementation fidelity and mechanisms. |\n| **PRIMROSE** (not detailed in the excerpt, but a prior SMI‑focused trial) | Tested a specific health‑promotion or disease‑management intervention in people with SMI. | • Modest effect sizes; unclear which behavior‑change techniques were most effective. | • DIAMONDS uses the Behaviour Change Technique Taxonomy and the Theoretical Domains Framework (Michie et al., 2012) to design the intervention and to systematically assess which components drive change. <br>• Builds on PRIMROSE’s content by adding a structured, theory‑based delivery model that can be replicated across sites. |\n\n### Specific ways the current study extends earlier work\n\n1. **Broader, more representative sample**  \n   * DIAMONDS includes all people with SMI, not just schizophrenia, and recruits across multiple NHS trusts, improving generalisability.\n\n2. **Rigorous trial design**  \n   * An internal pilot phase (with predefined success criteria) precedes the definitive randomized controlled trial, allowing for optimisation of recruitment, consent, and data collection procedures.\n\n3. **Implementation science framework**  \n   * Uses the Theoretical Domains Framework to identify barriers and facilitators to recruitment and adherence, and to tailor implementation strategies accordingly.\n\n4. **Behaviour‑change techniques (BCTs)**  \n   * The intervention is explicitly mapped to BCTs and their mechanisms of action, allowing for a clear understanding of *how* the intervention works—something that was less explicit in SCIMITAR+ and STEPWISE.\n\n5. **Process and economic evaluation**  \n   * A detailed process evaluation will capture fidelity, dose, reach, and context, while a cost‑effectiveness analysis will inform scalability—areas that were under‑explored in the earlier trials.\n\n6. **Longer follow‑up and outcome breadth**  \n   * DIAMONDS follows participants for 12 months (and potentially longer), measuring not only physical health outcomes but also quality of life, mental‑health service utilisation, and health‑care costs.\n\n7. **Integration of lessons learned**  \n   * The design of DIAMONDS explicitly incorporates the challenges identified in SCIMITAR+ (e.g., high attrition), STEPWISE (e.g., limited implementation data), and PRIMROSE (e.g., unclear BCT effectiveness), thereby creating a more robust, scalable intervention package.\n\nIn short, DIAMONDS takes the promising but limited evidence from SCIMITAR+, STEPWISE and PRIMROSE and turns it into a fully powered, theory‑driven, implementation‑ready trial that will generate high‑quality evidence on both effectiveness and the mechanisms that make the intervention work for people with serious mental illness."

    "question": ". What are \"trigger films,\" and what was their primary purpose in Stage 3 of the development process?",
    "answer": "**Trigger films** are short, animated “catalyst” videos that portray the lived experiences of people with serious mental illness (SMI) who are also managing a long‑term condition such as diabetes. The animations highlight key challenges, moments of frustration, and moments of success that the target users face in their daily self‑management.\n\n**Primary purpose in Stage 3**\n\n1. **Illustrate evidence‑based themes** – The films were created using the findings from earlier evidence synthesis and expert consensus (Stages 1 and 2). They visualised the mechanisms of action (MoAs) and behaviour change techniques (BCTs) that had been identified as most relevant.\n\n2. **Serve as discussion catalysts** – In Stage 4 co‑design workshops, the trigger films were shown to participants (service users, informal carers, and health‑care professionals) to spark conversation, surface personal experiences, and identify pain points in the care pathway.\n\n3. **Inform the design of the intervention** – The insights generated from viewing and discussing the films guided the co‑design team in refining modes of delivery, tailoring content, and ensuring the final digital intervention resonated with users’ real‑world needs.\n\nIn short, trigger films were animated, evidence‑driven videos used as a focal point for discussion and reflection, helping the team translate research findings into user‑centred design during Stage 3."

    "answer": "In this trial the two groups receive different “packages” of care:\n\n| Feature | Intervention group | Control group |\n|---------|--------------------|---------------|\n| **Usual care** | Both groups receive the standard health‑checks and community‑based mental‑health services that are normally offered to people with serious mental illness (SMI) and diabetes (e.g., CMHT visits, routine medical reviews). | Same usual care as the intervention group. |\n| **Additional intervention** | Participants are given a digital app (the DIAMONDS Voice app) and a printed workbook that guide them through self‑management of SMI and diabetes. They also receive ongoing support linked to the app and workbook. | No app or workbook is provided. |\n| **Signposting to services** | After randomisation, intervention participants are still sign‑posted to existing community services, but they also receive the app and workbook as part of the study. | After randomisation, participants are sign‑posted to the same existing services but **do not** receive the app or workbook. |\n| **Monitoring and follow‑up** | The intervention group is followed up with the same questionnaire schedule (baseline, 6 months, 12 months) but the study team also monitors app usage and workbook completion. | The control group is followed up with the same questionnaire schedule but no monitoring of app usage (since they do not receive an app). |\n\n**Bottom line:** The intervention group receives all the usual care plus an additional digital self‑management tool (app + workbook) and the associated support, whereas the control group receives only the usual care that is normally provided to people with SMI and diabetes."

    "question": "HeyoWhat approach did the researchers use to co-design the DIAMONDS intervention, and why was it valuable?",
    "answer": "**Co‑design approach used**\n\nThe DIAMONDS team used an *iterative, participatory co‑design process* that combined several research‑informed techniques:\n\n| Step | What was done | How it was carried out |\n|------|---------------|------------------------|\n| **1. Evidence synthesis** | Systematic reviews of self‑management interventions for people with type 2 diabetes and serious mental illness (SMI) were used to identify mechanisms of action (MoAs) and core components. | The reviews (refs 33, 34) and earlier qualitative work (ref 23) informed the initial design brief. |\n| **2. Stakeholder engagement** | Service users, carers, and healthcare professionals were invited to shape the intervention. | • Regularly scheduled **meetings** and **workshops** where participants discussed what they needed, what would work for them, and how the intervention could be delivered.<br>• The **DIAMONDS Voice** group (a service‑user and carer advisory panel) contributed to the study protocol and to the design of the “Change One Thing” workbook and app. |\n| **3. Consensus building** | Researchers sought agreement on the intervention’s content and delivery model. | • **Expert consensus surveys** were circulated to a wider group of clinicians and researchers to refine the proposed components.<br>• Feedback from the workshops was incorporated into a draft intervention, which was then re‑shared for further refinement. |\n| **4. Prototype testing** | A preliminary version of the intervention (app, workbook, and coaching model) was piloted. | The feasibility study (ISRCTN15328700) tested the combined weekly coaching sessions (face‑to‑face, phone or video) plus daily app use, allowing iterative tweaks before the RCT. |\n\n**Why this approach was valuable**\n\n1. **User‑centred relevance** – By involving people who actually live with T2DM and SMI from the outset, the intervention was grounded in real‑world priorities, increasing the likelihood that participants would find it useful and engaging.\n\n2. **Feasibility and acceptability** – The iterative workshops and prototype testing let researchers identify practical barriers (e.g., technology use, scheduling) early, reducing the risk of drop‑outs in the full trial.\n\n3. **Alignment with mechanisms of action** – The systematic‑review‑based MoAs guided the selection of behaviour‑change techniques, ensuring that the intervention was theoretically sound and could be evaluated for causal pathways.\n\n4. **Stakeholder buy‑in and sustainability** – Engaging clinicians, service managers, and third‑sector groups helped secure support for implementation and made it easier to embed the intervention within existing health‑care pathways once proven effective.\n\n5. **Transparency and rigor** – Documenting each step (meetings, surveys, workshops) and making the co‑design process publicly available (e.g., through the DIAMONDS Voice website) enhances the credibility of the study and provides a model for future interventions.\n\nIn short, the researchers used a structured, multi‑stage co‑design process that combined evidence synthesis, stakeholder workshops, consensus surveys, and prototype testing. This approach ensured that the DIAMONDS intervention was theoretically grounded, practically feasible, and genuinely responsive to the needs of people with T2DM and SMI, thereby maximizing its potential effectiveness and real‑world impact."

  {
    "question": "What approach did the researchers use to co-design the DIAMONDS intervention, and why was it valuable?",
    "answer": "The DIAMONDS team used a **structured co‑design process** that combined three key elements:\n\n| Element | What was done | Why it was valuable |\n|---------|---------------|---------------------|\n| **Systematic reviews & qualitative evidence** | The team first reviewed the literature on self‑management support for people with type 2 diabetes and serious mental illness, and carried out qualitative interviews and focus groups with patients, carers and clinicians. | This provided a robust evidence base and uncovered the real‑world barriers and facilitators that the intervention needed to address. |\n| **Stakeholder workshops and consensus surveys** | Service users, carers, mental‑health professionals and diabetes specialists were invited to a series of workshops. In these meetings they discussed the findings, brainstormed solutions, and completed expert‑consensus surveys to prioritise features of the program. | Bringing the end‑users and frontline staff together ensured that the content, tone and delivery methods of the intervention were grounded in lived experience and clinical reality. |\n| **Ongoing input from the DIAMONDS Voice group** | The DIAMONDS Voice group – a service‑user and carer panel that has been part of the programme for years – reviewed drafts of the protocol, the workbook, the app (“Change One Thing”) and the training materials for the DIAMONDS Coaches. | Their continuous feedback helped keep the intervention user‑friendly, culturally appropriate and aligned with the needs of people with T2DM and SMI, thereby enhancing acceptability and feasibility. |\n\n**Why this approach was considered valuable**\n\n1. **User‑centred relevance** – By involving people who would actually use the program, the team could tailor content, language and format to the specific challenges faced by those with T2DM and serious mental illness.  \n2. **Feasibility and acceptability** – Early testing and discussion with clinicians and coaches identified practical delivery issues (e.g., session length, digital literacy), allowing the intervention to be refined before the RCT.  \n3. **Theoretical grounding** – The co‑design process fed directly into the development of the mechanisms of action (MoAs) and the theoretical framework, ensuring that the intervention was not only pragmatic but also theoretically sound.  \n4. **Stakeholder buy‑in** – Engaging a broad range of stakeholders from the outset fostered ownership and increased the likelihood that the intervention would be adopted in routine practice after the trial.  \n\nIn short, the co‑design method—systematic reviews, qualitative work, workshops, consensus surveys and continuous user feedback—was chosen because it produced an intervention that was evidence‑based, user‑friendly, theoretically robust and practically deliverable."

    "question": "What are the main barriers to self-management for people with SMI?",
    "answer": "**Main obstacles to self‑management for people with serious mental illness (SMI)** – as identified in the qualitative study by Carswell et al. (BMC Psychiatry 2022) and corroborated by related research – can be grouped into three broad themes:\n\n| Theme | Key obstacles |\n|-------|---------------|\n| **1. Personal and cognitive barriers** | • **Cognitive difficulties** (e.g., memory, attention, executive function) that make planning and following health‑management plans hard.<br>• **Low confidence / self‑efficacy** in managing physical health, often linked to past negative experiences or feeling “not good enough.”<br>• **Medication side‑effects** (weight gain, fatigue) that reduce motivation or ability to engage in healthy behaviours. |\n| **2. Systemic and relational barriers** | • **Negative experiences with health‑care services** (e.g., perceived stigma, feeling dismissed or misunderstood) that reduce willingness to attend appointments or share concerns.<br>• **Fragmented care**: lack of coordinated support between mental‑health and physical‑health teams, leading to unclear responsibilities and duplicated or missing information.<br>• **Limited access to tailored resources** (e.g., self‑management programmes that are not adapted for SMI, lack of peer‑support or community links). |\n| **3. Practical and environmental barriers** | • **Financial constraints** and competing priorities (e.g., housing, employment) that limit time and resources for self‑management.<br>• **Physical environment** (e.g., unsafe neighbourhoods, lack of safe spaces for exercise) that hampers healthy behaviours.<br>• **Social isolation** and lack of a supportive network to encourage or remind them of health‑management tasks. |\n\n**Bottom line:**  \nPeople with SMI face a combination of cognitive, relational, and practical challenges that together make consistent self‑management of physical health conditions difficult. Addressing these obstacles requires coordinated, stigma‑free care, tailored support programmes, and practical assistance that takes into account the unique lived experience of those with serious mental illness."
